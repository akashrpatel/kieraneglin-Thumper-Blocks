# Changelog

## Rev 2 (2023-11-10)

- Updated tophat and filament path to use a two-landing design for the `up` vs. `down` positions. This makes the `up` position more reliable and repeatable. Don't forget to use the Springy servo arms!
- Updates some chamfers on the base (inconsequential)

## Rev 1 (2023-08-15)

Initial release!
